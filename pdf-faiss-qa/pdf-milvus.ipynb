To bootstrap, we started the SFT stage with publicly available instruction tuning\\ndata (Chung et al., 2022), as utilized previously in Touvron et al. (2023).\\nQuality Is All You Need.

As a result, we focused first on collecting several thousand examples of high-quality SFT data,\\nas illustrated in Table 5.

For supervised fine-tuning, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with an initial\\nlearning rate of 2×10−5, a weight decay of 0.1, a batch size of 64, and a sequence length of 4096 tokens.\\nFor the fine-tuning process, each sample consists of a prompt and an answer.

We were able to mitigate this by consolidating the model weights to each node once before generation\\nand then freeing the memory after generation, resuming the rest of the training loop.\\n3.3 System Message for Multi-Turn Consistency\\nIn a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly,\\nor to“act as”some public figure. When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat , the subsequent\\nresponse should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial\\ninstruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).\\nTo address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context\\nDistillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage\\nprocess. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).\\nGAttMethod. Assumewe haveaccess toa multi-turndialoguedataset betweentwo persons(e.g., auser\\nand an assistant), with a list of messages [u1, a1, . . . , u n, an], where unandancorrespond to the user and\\nassistant messages for turn n, respectively. Then, we define an instruction, inst, that should be respected\\nthroughout the dialogue. For example, instcould be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this\\ninstruction to all the user messages of the conversation.\\nNext, we can sample from this synthetic data using the latest RLHF model. We now have a context-dialogue\\nandthesamplewithwhichtofine-tuneamodel,inaprocessanalogoustoRejectionSampling.

To fix this issue, which could hurt the training, we\\nsimply set the loss to 0 for all the tokens from the previous turns, including assistant messages.\\nFor the training instructions, we created a few synthetic constraints to sample from: Hobbies ( “You enjoy\\ne.g. Tennis” ),Language ( “Speakine.g. French” ),or PublicFigure( “Actase.g. Napoleon” ). Toobtainthelists\\nof hobbies and public figures, we asked Llama 2-Chat to generate it, avoiding a mismatch between the\\ninstructionandmodelknowledge(e.g.,askingthemodeltoactassomeoneithadnotencounteredduring\\ntraining).

Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes.

We therefore perform safety context distillation only on adversarial prompts.\\nHowever, we observed that context distillation can sometimes degrade response quality, even when dealing\\nwith adversarial prompts.

Crucially, after each exercise, we performed a thorough\\nanalysis of the collected data, including dialogue length, risk area distribution, histogram of topic of misin-\\nformation (where appropriate), and rated degree of risk.

However, reinforcement\\nlearning proved highly effective, particularly given its cost and time effectiveness. Our findings underscore\\nthat the crucial determinant of RLHF’s success lies in the synergy it fosters between humans and LLMs\\nthroughout the annotation process.\\nEvenwithproficientannotators,eachindividualwriteswithsignificantvariation. Amodelfine-tunedon\\nSFTannotationlearnsthisdiversity,including,unfortunately,thetail-endofpoorlyexecutedannotation. Fur-\\nthermore, the model’s performance is capped by the writing abilities of the most skilled annotators. Human\\nannotators are arguably less subject to discrepancy when comparing two outputs’ preference annotation\\nforRLHF.Consequently,therewardmechanismswiftlylearnstoassignlowscorestoundesirabletail-end\\ndistribution and aligns towards the human preference. This phenomena is illustrated in Figure 20, where we\\ncan see that the worst answers are progressively removed, shifting the distribution to the right.\\nIn addition, during annotation, the model has the potential to venture into writing trajectories that even the\\nbestannotatorsmaynotchart. Nonetheless,humanscanstillprovidevaluablefeedbackwhencomparingtwo\\nanswers, beyond their own writing competencies. Drawing a parallel, while we may not all be accomplished\\nartists, our ability to appreciate and critique art remains intact. We posit that the superior writing abilities of\\nLLMs, as manifested in surpassing human annotators in certain tasks, are fundamentally driven by RLHF, as\\ndocumented in Gilardi et al. (2023) and Huang et al. (2023). Supervised data may no longer be the gold\\nstandard, and this evolving circumstance compels a re-evaluation of the concept of “supervision.”\\nIn-ContextTemperatureRescaling.

The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022).

The method, first showcased by Stiennon et al.\\n(2020) in the context of text-summarization tasks, has since been extended to a range of other applications.\\nIn this paradigm, models are fine-tuned based on feedback from human users, thus iteratively aligning the\\nmodels’ responses more closely with human expectations and preferences.\\nOuyang et al. (2022) demonstrates that a combination of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF can help fix\\nissues with factuality, toxicity, and helpfulness that cannot be remedied by simply scaling up LLMs. Bai\\net al. (2022b) partially automates this fine-tuning-plus-RLHF approach by replacing the human-labeled\\nfine-tuningdatawiththemodel’sownself-critiquesandrevisions,andbyreplacinghumanraterswitha\\nmodel when ranking model outputs in RLHF, a process known as “RL from AI Feedback” (RLAIF).\\nKnown LLM Safety Challenges.

Astandardpracticeforautoregressivedecodingistocachethekey(K)and\\nvalue (V) pairs for the previous tokens in the sequence, speeding up attention computation. With increasing\\ncontext windows or batch sizes, however, the memory costs associated with the KV cache size in multi-head\\nattention (MHA) models grow significantly. For larger models, where KV cache size becomes a bottleneck,\\nkeyandvalueprojectionscanbesharedacrossmultipleheadswithoutmuchdegradationofperformance\\n(Chowdheryetal.,2022). Eithertheoriginalmulti-queryformatwithasingleKVprojection(MQA, Shazeer,\\n2019) or a grouped-query attention variant with 8 KV projections (GQA, Ainslie et al., 2023) can be used.\\nIn Table 18, we compare MQA and GQA variants with an MHA baseline. We train all models with 150B\\ntokens while keeping a fixed 30B model size. To keep a similar overall parameter count across GQA and\\nMQA, we increase the dimension of the feed-forward layers to compensate for the reduction in the attention\\nlayers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we\\nincrease it by a factor of 1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the\\nMHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.\\nTooptimizeforlatency,wehostourlargestmodelsusing8A100sinasinglenodewithtensorparallelism\\n(Shoeybietal.,2019).

In total, we collected 14 batches of human\\npreferencedata(i.e.,MetaSafety+Helpfulness)onaweeklybasis,consistingofover1millionbinarymodel\\ngeneration comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over\\ntime and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We\\nalso intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the\\naverage number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.\\nIn Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share\\nof samples with similar responses (e.g., negligibly better or unsure ) increase dramatically over time while\\nthose with stronger preference (e.g., significantly better ) drop in the meantime.

This was a deliberately\\nconservativeapproachinordertoproducea“clean”subsetofthedatawithhighprecision,andisusedin\\nopen-sourced evaluation libraries (e.g. Gao et al. (2021)).\\nThis approach, however, was unable to detect precisely what proportion of a given sample is contaminated,\\nand didn’t take into account how evaluation datasets are constructed. Furthermore, as noted in Chowdhery\\netal.(2022),somedatasets(suchasBoolQ)containcontextsextractedverbatimfromtheweb,butnotthe\\nquestionandanswercontinuation. Assuch,highlycontaminatedsamplesfromthesedatasetsareunlikely\\ntogainanunfairadvantage. ThemethodologyinChowdheryetal.(2022)furtherimprovesontheearlier\\nn-gram collision detection by considering a sample to be contaminated if 70% of all 8-grams can be found at\\nleast once in the training data.\\nThe previous methodologies noted above all consider contamination in text space, and don’t appear to\\nconsidertheformattingofpromptsusedforactualevaluation. Incontrast,weinsteadmatchontokenized\\ninput,beingcarefultopassfullyverbalizedevaluationsamplestothetokenizer. Wealsodivergefromthe\\nprevious methodologies by considering contamination from a bottom-up perspective. We consider a token\\ntobecontaminatedifitappearsinanytoken n-gramlongerthan10tokensinboththeevaluationsample\\nand the training set, and define the contamination percentage of a sample to be the percentage of tokens\\ncontaminated. Thisallowsustoviewthebenchmarkperformanceofourmodelsonarangeofcontamination\\nscales, while retaining the ability to test a high-precision clean subset (samples with <20%contamination)\\nand a high-precision contaminated subset (samples with >80%contamination). In order to account for the\\nvagaries of the precise format of verbalized samples, we allow a small \"skipgram budget\" of four tokens, so\\nthat matchedspans between anevaluation sampleand the trainingdata can differin at mostfour positions\\n(we do not allow trailing mismatches, or mismatches in the first 10 tokens).\\nWe identify such 10(+)-skipgrams with suffix arrays implemented using a variation of the library from Lee\\netal.(2022),modifiedtoworkonaPySparkcluster(effectivelywithoutrandomaccesstodisk). Giventhe\\nembarrassinglyparallelnatureofthetask,weareabletofindallsuch10-grams(andtheirfulllengths)in\\nour entire dataset in around seven hours (including time to tokenize), utilizing an estimated 1,500 cores.\\nAs there are many confounding factors at play when determining whether dataset contamination has\\ncontributedtoevaluationperformance(mostlystemmingfromthefactthat\"clean\"and\"dirty\"subsetsdo\\nnot necessarily well-estimate the population distribution), we make the following assumption: In the event\\nof dataset contamination contributing to evaluation performance, we expect both the \"cleanest\" examples to', metadata={'source': 'llama2.pdf', 'page': 74}),\n",
